### Open Graph & Meta Image Fixes (May 2025)
- **Universal OG Image:** The site now uses a single Open Graph image for all pages: [`/og-image.png`](public/og-image.png). This image was manually edited and optimized for size and clarity, which finally resolved persistent OG image loading issues in WhatsApp, iMessage, and other platforms. If you need to update the OG image, edit this file directly.
- **SVG Workflow:** The square OG image [`/og-image-square.svg`](public/og-image-square.svg) is maintained in the codebase and should be updated using Figma. Always keep the SVG in sync with your latest branding/artwork.
- **Cleanup:** All unused, duplicate, and large OG/test images have been removed from the repo. Only the universal PNG and SVG remain.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Only one OG image is specified in the Next.js metadata for universal compatibility.
  - No duplicate or conflicting OG meta tags in the HTML head‚ÄîNext.js Metadata API handles all meta generation.
  - OG image is 1200x630px, PNG, and under 300KB for maximum compatibility with all social and messaging platforms.
- **Standardized Metadata:** All major pages (home, case studies, legal, contact) have dedicated `metadata.ts` files with consistent structure and image dimensions.
- **Contact Page Metadata:** Added a new `metadata.ts` for the contact page and refactored the page to import it.
- **Troubleshooting:** Multiple attempts were made to fix OG image loading issues, including switching between absolute and relative URLs, and adding `secureUrl` for Facebook/Twitter compatibility. The final, working solution uses a single, manually optimized PNG and a clean metadata setup.

#### How to Add Metadata for New Pages
1. Create a `metadata.ts` file in the page directory (e.g. `/app/newpage/metadata.ts`).
2. Use `/og-image.png` for the `openGraph.images` field for universal OG image coverage, or update `/og-image.png` if you want to change the image for the whole site.
3. If you update the SVG, use Figma and export to `/og-image-square.svg`.
4. Import and export the metadata in your page file if needed.
5. Analytics integration is not included by default.

#### Example OG Image Metadata
```ts
openGraph: {
  images: [
    {
      url: '/og-image.png',
      secureUrl: '[REDACTED_FOR_OPEN_SOURCE]',
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      alt: 'BuiltIt.dev - AI-Ready MVPs. Expertly Shipped.',
      type: 'image/png',
    }
  ]
}
// For SVG (branding, not OG): Edit `/og-image-square.svg` in Figma and keep it up to date in the repo.
```

- **All email addresses (footer, Terms, Privacy, Cookie Policy) are protected from scraping using the ObfuscatedEmail component.** Emails are revealed immediately on page load for users, but are never present in static HTML. This dramatically reduces spam and scraping risk, while maintaining accessibility and user experience.
- **Footer & Policy Pages:** email@example.com and email@example.com are shown as normal, clickable email addresses immediately. There are no [at]/[dot] placeholders anywhere on the site.
- **Security:** Emails are assembled client-side from separate user/domain props, so bots scraping HTML can't harvest them. No emails are present in static HTML output.
- **Metadata Compliance:** Policy pages use layout.tsx for metadata, enabling Framer Motion and Next.js 14 compatibility.
- **Build/Deployment:** Fully Next.js 14-compliant, with Framer Motion and SEO preserved.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend & Contact Form Integration

### Contact Form Workflow
1. **Frontend:** User submits the form on `/contact` or ContactSection
2. **Cloudflare Worker:** Receives POST, validates origin, proxies JSON to Google Apps Script
3. **Google Apps Script:**
   - Validates fields: `name`, `email`, `budget`, `message`
   - Appends row to Google Sheet: `[timestamp, name, email, company, budget, message, source]`
   - Sends notification email with all fields
   - Returns JSON `{ status: 'success', ... }` or error
4. **Frontend:** Parses JSON response, shows success/failure state

### Cloudflare Worker
- File: `/workers/contact-form-worker.js`
- Allows CORS for production and localhost
- Proxies requests to `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL`
- Returns Apps Script response with proper headers

### Google Apps Script
- Receives JSON, validates, writes to sheet, sends email
- Sheet columns: Timestamp, Name, Email, Company, Budget, Message, Source
- Logs all steps for debugging (see "Executions" in Apps Script editor)

### CORS

- Apps Script URL is only accessible via the worker

### Troubleshooting
- **Form not working?**
  - Check browser console for error details
  - Check Cloudflare Worker logs (Cloudflare dashboard)
  - Check Google Apps Script "Executions" for logs/errors
  - Ensure Apps Script has updated `doPost` to match schema
  - Verify Sheet columns match: Timestamp, Name, Email, Company, Budget, Message, Source

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development & Contribution

### SEO Troubleshooting
- For OG images, use Facebook Sharing Debugger or Twitter Card Validator to confirm correct image loading. If images do not appear, double-check relative paths and `secureUrl` fields, and ensure images are in the `/public` directory.
- All OG fixes are global‚Äîno need to update for new pages if you follow the patterns above.


### Local Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Deploying & Updating Backend

This repository includes two example backend scripts for handling contact form submissions and proxying requests securely:

### 1. `/backend/cloudflare-worker`
- **File:** `index.js`
- **Purpose:** Cloudflare Worker code for securely proxying contact form submissions to your Google Apps Script endpoint, with CORS handling and origin validation.
- **Security:** All real origins and script URLs are replaced with clear placeholders. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` with your own values before deploying.
- **Usage:** Deploy as a Cloudflare Worker. Update placeholders for your production domains and script endpoint.

### 2. `/backend/google-apps-script`
- **File:** `contact-form.gs`
- **Purpose:** Google Apps Script code to receive POST requests from the contact form, write submissions to a Google Sheet, and send a notification email.
- **Security:** All sensitive values (spreadsheet ID, sheet name, email recipient) are replaced with placeholders. Fill in your own values before use.
- **Usage:** Deploy as a Google Apps Script Web App. Replace all placeholder values with your actual Google Sheet and email information.

**Note:**
- All backend code is anonymized and safe for open source sharing.
- See the README files in each backend subfolder for more specific setup instructions.
- Update Cloudflare Worker via dashboard or Wrangler
- Update Google Apps Script via script editor and redeploy
- Update allowed origins for CORS as needed

### Contribution Guidelines
- All major UI, logic, or backend changes **must** be documented in `/docs/architecture.md`
- Keep this README and docs up to date
- Use clear commit messages and PR descriptions

## üé≠ Animation Strategy

### Framer Motion Implementation
- **Entrance Animations**: Staggered reveals for sections
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scale and glow effects
- **Scroll Animations**: Elements animate in as they enter viewport
- **Micro-interactions**: Button hovers, card lifts, icon rotations

### Performance Considerations
- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- `will-change` property used sparingly
- Reduced motion support via `prefers-reduced-motion`

## üìù Content Strategy

### Key Messaging
1. **Speed**: "14-day delivery guarantee"
2. **Quality**: "Production-ready MVPs"
3. **Success**: "$2.5M+ funding raised by clients"
4. **Trust**: "92% success rate"

### Tone of Voice
- Professional yet approachable
- Confident without being arrogant
- Technical but accessible
- Results-focused

## üöÄ Development Workflow

- `build`: Production build
- `start`: Production server
- `lint`: ESLint checking

## üé® Design Decisions

### Why This Approach?
1. **Dark Mode**: Aligns with developer/tech audience preferences
2. **Minimal Gradients**: Cleaner, more professional appearance
3. **Component-Based**: Maintainable and scalable architecture
4. **Animation-Rich**: Engages users without overwhelming
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for all devices
